Similar to select() statement there is other one called pselect().

eg)
#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 600
#include <sys/select.h>

int pselect(int n,
            fd_set *readfds,
            fd_set *writefds,
            fd_set *exceptfds,
            const struct timespec *timeout,
            const sigset_t *sigmask;
            );

The two main difference between select and pselect is

1) it uses a structure called timespec unlike select which uses timeval
   struct timespec{
      long tv_sec;
      long tv_nsec;
   }

2) sigset_t *sigmask is used to avoid race conditions between waiting on files for IO when this argument is
   set to NULL this pselect() behaves as select()
